# Box

It's what in material design you would call Card. It's a container for
other elements.

They may seem similar to panes.

They indeed define positioning, but only for the internal elements.

The positioning of the box itself respect the page has to be defined by a pane
containing the box.

It may define the background, display, border, height, padding and margin.

It may define a flex model for the elements it contains.

It may define some padding or margin for the elements inside.
