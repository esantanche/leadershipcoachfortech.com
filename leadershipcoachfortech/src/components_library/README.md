# Components library

The components you find here are the building blocks of the interface.

Each type of component is defined in its folder.

See the README files in each folder for definition of each type of component.

The general idea is that you find CSSinJS classes only in this components library.

Higher level components like Screens shouldn't have any CSSinJS or inline style.

This way styling is encapsulated inside a component and it's hidden to
higher level components.

The library used to implement css in js is this one: https://github.com/cssinjs/react-jss
